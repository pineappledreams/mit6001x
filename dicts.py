"""
Functions are first class objects.
They have types, can be elements of data structures and can appear in expressions.
We can use functions as arguments in lists, which will give us the power of
higher order programming.

Now we can do a lot of things.

seq[i] - ith element of sequence
len[seq] - length of sequence
seq1 + seq2 - concatenation of sequence
n * seq - sequence that repeats seq n times 
seq[start:end] - slice of sequence
e in seq - true if e contained in sequence
e not in seq - true if e contained in sequence
for e in seq - iterates over elements of sequence.

DICTIONARIES
have keys and values.

my_dict = {}
grades = ('ana':'b', "john":'b')
